## What is PSense?
Probabilistic inference can naturally fit statistical models and have many important applications. However, the sensitivity of probabilistic inference has not received due attention. In this ecosystem, we lack various tools that can help researchers and developers analyze their probabilistic programs. Therefore, we built [PSense](http://psense.info) to help programmers understand the sensitivity of their models. To the best of our knowledge, PSense is the first system for automated symbolic analysis of sensitivity in probabilistic programs. It takes programs written in the source language of PSI and automatically evaluates the convergence of posterior distribution with interference in prior distribution.
